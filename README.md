# Written Guide
This is a written guide explaining how to install WinDeckOS using an external Windows PC.

## Requirements
1. An external PC running Windows
2. Some kind of external storage device with at least 12GB of usuable storage and a way to connect it to your Steam Deck
3. A Steam Deck (or maybe some other device you want to try downloading this too)

It is recommended that the external storage device contains at least 16GB, although technically, as long as there is 12GB of usuable memory, this should work.
This should work on an SD card, although I haven't tested that personally so I can't confirm anything.
This will completely wipe your steam deck, so be sure to back up any files, such as saves, you wish too keep. Not every steam game supports cloud saves so keep that in mind before continuing.

## Step One: Formatting the Deck's Drive
You can skip to step 2 if you already have windows installed, or if the drive your using is already completely wiped

### Media Creation Tool
Download the Media Creation tool for windows [here.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295) Once it's finished downloading, run it, and make sure your external storage device is connected. 
Accept the windows license agreement and when asked about language and edition, choose whatever you want and click next. When asked which media to use - enseure you click "USB flash drive", then click next. Select the external drive your using for setup, then click next. 
The installer will tell you that your device is ready and you can now safely close it and insert the drive into your Steam Deck.
### Booting the external drive
Ensure your external drive is connected to your Steam Deck and then hold down the volume down key and press the power button one time. Your deck will beep and then it should boot into the Bios. From here, select whatever external drive your using for setup and it should
boot the windows installer in vertical mode.
